# NeuroBee
This is a web application that takes care of you mental health and helps improve your moods and relief stress.

*NeuroBee
A bee that cares*


Problem :
In India, the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 reveals that nearly 15% Indian adults need active intervention for one or more mental health issues and one in 20 Indians suffers from depression

As the society is moving faster than ever, people are facing more solitude and isolation, having no one to talk to, to express their problems,soon develop mental disorders like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses which might lead to suicides.  


Solution :
        We are going to develop a chatbot based web app which would help people to recover from such mental disorders by regularly monitoring them and entertaining them, the bee is funny and highly talkative.




Features to be implemented:
Link to Relaxing video on YouTube 
Stress buster Games( tic tac toe, tetris, slimy)(tentative)
positive quotes which keep changing each day
A link to google maps to locate nearest doctors, their contact info
Notify two close friends if the user is having a suicidal tendency
list of user's friend info along with national helplines 
Mood tracker / regular lite mental checkup
Notification alert to drink water
Personalized chat experience after logging in.
.


The most significant part of this project is its future implementation, with an ambition of adding more features and reaching to more users in the near future, to impact and save more lives lost every year due to mental diseases, people finding them alone, with no one to talk to.
